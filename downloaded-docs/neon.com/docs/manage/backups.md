Neon supports different backup strategies, which you can use separately or in combination, depending on your requirements.

## Instant restore

With Neon's instant restore capability, also known as point-in-time restore or PITR, you can automatically retain a "history" of changes, ranging from 1 day up to 30 days, depending on your Neon plan. This feature lets you restore your database to any specific moment without the need for traditional database backups or separate backup automation. It's ideal if your primary concern is fast recovery after an unexpected event.

With this strategy, the only required action is setting your desired [history window](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/history-window). Please keep in mind that increasing your history window also increases storage, as changes to your data are retained for a longer period.

To get started, see [Instant restore](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/branch-restore).

## Backups with `pg_dump`

For business continuity, disaster recovery, or compliance, you can use standard Postgres tools to back up and restore your database. Neon supports traditional backup workflows using `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.

To learn how, see [Backups with pg_dump](https://neon.com/docs/manage/backup-pg-dump).

## Automated backups with `pg_dump`

If you need to automate `pg_dump` backups to remote storage, we provide a two-part guide that walks you through setting up an S3 bucket and a GitHub Action to automate `pg_dump` backups on a recurring schedule. You'll also learn how to configure retention settings to manage how long `pg_dump` backups are stored before being deleted.

1. [Create an S3 bucket to store Postgres backups](https://neon.com/docs/manage/backups-aws-s3-backup-part-1)
2. [Set up a GitHub Action to perform nightly Postgres backups](https://neon.com/docs/manage/backups-aws-s3-backup-part-2)
