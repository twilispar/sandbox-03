# Neon Auth roadmap

What's supported today and what's coming next

**Note: Beta**

The **Neon Auth with Better Auth** is in Beta. Share your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or via the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback).

Neon Auth is in active development. This page shows what's currently supported and what we're working on next.

## General availability

Neon Auth is targeting general availability this quarter. We're actively working on additional plugins and features to bring Neon Auth out of beta.

## Frameworks

### Supported

| Framework               | Status      | Quick start                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Next.js                 | ✅ Supported | [Get started](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/nextjs-api-only) |
| Vite + React            | ✅ Supported | [Get started](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/react)           |
| React + React Router    | ✅ Supported | [Get started](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/react)           |
| React + TanStack Router | ✅ Supported | [Get started](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/tanstack-router) |

The [React quick start](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/react) steps through a **Vite** + React app. If you use **React Router** for URLs and layouts, use the same Neon Auth URL, `@neondatabase/neon-js` client, and SDK calls from that guide, then integrate them into your router and route components. For file-based routing with TanStack, use the TanStack Router quick start instead.

### On the roadmap

| Framework                     | Status          |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| Standalone frontend + backend | 🔜 Coming soon  |
| Other frameworks              | Based on demand |

**Note: Standalone architectures**

Architectures where frontend and backend are separate deployments (for example, Create-React-App with a separate Node/Express backend) are not yet supported. Neon Auth uses HTTP-only cookies for secure session management, and these cookies cannot be securely shared between frontend and backend applications on different domains. We're actively working on this.

## Better Auth plugins

Neon Auth is built on [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/). Not all Better Auth plugins are currently supported.

### Supported

See [Set up OAuth](https://neon.com/docs/auth/guides/setup-oauth) for Neon-specific OAuth configuration (including Vercel). Email flows such as verification and password reset are covered in [Email verification](https://neon.com/docs/auth/guides/email-verification), [Password reset](https://neon.com/docs/auth/guides/password-reset), and [User management](https://neon.com/docs/auth/guides/user-management).
