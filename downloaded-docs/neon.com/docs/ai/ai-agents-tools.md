# AI tools for Agents

AI-powered tools for development and database management

Neon is the backend for apps and agents. This page covers Neon's integrations with AI tools and agent frameworks, from natural language database control to autonomous agent platforms. Choose the tools that fit your workflow.

## Quick setup

The fastest way to get started with Neon and AI:

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init
```

This authenticates via OAuth, creates an API key, configures your editor or CLI, and installs [agent skills](https://github.com/neondatabase/agent-skills). Then restart and ask your AI assistant **"Get started with Neon"**.

## MCP integration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI tools to interact with Neon databases using natural language, providing secure and contextual access to your data and infrastructure.

- [Neon MCP Server](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server): Learn about managing your Neon projects using natural language with Neon MCP Server
- [Connect MCP clients](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon): Learn how to connect MCP clients like Cursor, Claude Code, and ChatGPT to your Neon database

## Claude Code plugin

If you're using Claude Code, install the Neon plugin to get Skills, MCP integration, and all the context rules in one package.

- [Claude Code plugin for Neon](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-claude-code-plugin): Includes Claude Code Skills for Neon, Neon MCP integration, and context rules

## Cursor plugin

If you're using Cursor, install the Neon plugin to get Neon Skills and MCP integration in one package.

- [Cursor plugin for Neon](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-cursor-plugin): Install the Neon Cursor plugin to use Neon Skills and Neon MCP integration directly in Cursor

## GitHub Copilot agents

Custom agents for GitHub Copilot that bring Neon's branching workflow directly into VS Code for safe migrations and query optimization.

- [Neon agents for GitHub Copilot](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-github-copilot-agents): Safe database migrations and query optimization using Neon branching

## Agent Skills

Give your AI assistant structured context about Neon's features, APIs, and best practices.

- [Agent Skills](https://neon.com/docs/ai/agent-skills): Install Neon Agent Skills for accurate code suggestions covering Auth, Drizzle, serverless connections, APIs, and more

## Build AI agents

Create autonomous agents that can manage and interact with your Neon databases programmatically. Build with our terse JavaScript client or the Neon API.

- [Neon for AI agent platforms](https://neon.com/use-cases/ai-agents): Read about Neon as a solution for agents that need backends.
- [@neondatabase/toolkit](https://github.com/neondatabase/toolkit): A terse JavaScript client for spinning up Postgres databases and running SQL queries
- [Database versioning](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-database-versioning): How AI agents and codegen platforms use Neon snapshot APIs for database versioning
- [Neon API](https://neon.com/docs/reference/api-reference): Integrate using the Neon API

## Agent frameworks

Build AI agents using popular frameworks that integrate with Neon.

- [AgentStack Integration](https://neon.com/guides/agentstack-neon): Build and deploy AI agents with AgentStack's CLI and Neon integration
- [AutoGen Integration](https://neon.com/guides/autogen-neon): Create collaborative AI agents with Microsoft AutoGen and Neon
- [Azure AI Agent Service](https://neon.com/guides/azure-ai-agent-service): Build enterprise AI agents with Azure AI Agent Service and Neon
- [Composio + CrewAI](https://neon.com/guides/composio-crewai-neon): Create multi-agent systems with CrewAI and Neon
